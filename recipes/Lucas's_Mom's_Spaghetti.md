I swam in high school and this sustained me. Slightly more invovled than a typical meatsauce but well worth it. Takes about 45 mins all in and you'll have leftovers for days

### Ingredients
- 4 small white onions (or 2 large ones if you love onions)
- 2.5 pounds of 80/20 grounnd beef
- 5 cloves of garlic (diced)
- 2 tablespooon of salt
- 2 tablespoons of pepper
- 4 tablespoons of italian seasoning
- 2 15 oz cans of tomato sauce
- 1 6 oz can of tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon of sugar
- Your favorite pasta (ahem... penne)

### Instructions
1. Chop the onions and add them to a large pot on medium high
2. Add the ground beef
3. Chop and add the garlic
4. Add the pepper, salt, and italian seasoning
5. After the beef is brown, add the tomato sauce and tomato paste
6. Start the pasta in a separate pot.
6. Turn down the of the heat of the meatsauce to medium and add extra flavor as needed
7. Add water (roughly equal to one and a half of the 6 oz tomato paste can) 
8. Add sugar
9. Simmer until ready

Enjoy!
