## Angeli's Jalebi
Store-bought jalebi can be crusty or stale by the time it gets to your mouth. My family recipe enables the sweet taste of the cherished Indian dessert to be made and eaten while it's crispy and fresh. Serves 10 people, about 1 hour total time spent prepping and cooking.

### Ingredients
*For the pastry*
- 1 cup all-purpose maida (all-purpose wheat flour)
- 2 tbsp. besan (gram flour)
- 4 tbsp. plain yogurt
- 1 tbsp. ghee
- 1/2 cup warm water
- 1/4 tsp. baking soda
- oil or ghee for frying

*For the syrup*
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 tsp. ground cardamom
- 1 pinch saffron
- 1 tsp. lemon juice

### Instructions
1. Add maida, besan, and baking soda to a bowl and mix. Then add ghee, yogurt, and water and mix until lump-free.
2. Allow batter to stand for 20 minutes.
3. Make the syrup by adding sugar, water, cardamom, and saffron to a saucepan. Cook until boiling and then allow contents to simmer for 5-7 minutes. Then, stir in the lemon juice.
4. After 20 minutes of standing aside, pour the batter into a bottle with a thin opening (2-3 mm wide).
5. With oil or ghee heated in a frying pan over medium heat, squeeze the bottle and make spirals of the dough, starting from the inside to outside. You can make about 5 circles for each jalebi.
6. Fry jalebis for 1-2 minutes on low heat. Then, flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until lightly golden brown.
7. Drain the oil from the jalebis with a spotted spatula. Then, dip the jalebis in the warm syrup for a few seconds on each side. Remove the jalebis and place on a plate.

Enjoy!
